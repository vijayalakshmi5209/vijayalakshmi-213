ALGORITHM:
step 1: start
step 2: since o(n) is the complexity,fetching the size(s).
step 3: to get the array of size(s).
step 4:  considering two integers i and j.
step 5: i is initialized from 0 and j is initialized to the last element.
step 6: element of i is stored to temp, element of j is stored to i and element of temp is stored to j.(swapping elements).
step 7: i is incremented and j is decremented.
step 8:  if  i is less than j, step 6 is repeated.
step 9:  the reversed array is printed.
step 10: end

PROGRAM:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int s;
printf("Enter the size:");
scanf("%d",&s);//since it has to be in o(n) complexity, fetching the size.
int a[100],i,j,temp;
for(i=0;i<size;i++)
{
scanf("%d",&a[i]);//to get the array.
}
j=s-1;
i=0;
while(i<j)//so that the order is not repeated.
{
 temp=a[i];
 a[i]=a[j];
 a[j]=temp;
 i++;
 j--;
}
printf("Reversed array is:");
for(i=0;i<size;i++)
{
 printf("%d",a[i]);
